How does the Diffing Algorithm works?
The diffing algorithm in React follows a set of steps to efficiently update the DOM:

1- Virtual DOM Representation: React maintains a virtual representation of the DOM, known as the Virtual DOM. When data changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.
2- Element Diffing: React performs a diffing process by comparing the previous Virtual DOM tree with the new one. It identifies the differences between the two trees.
3- Minimal Updates: Instead of updating the entire DOM, React generates a minimal set of updates needed to transform the current DOM to match the new Virtual DOM.
4- Batching Updates: To avoid excessive DOM manipulations, React batched updates and applies them in a single batch. This reduces browser reflows and improves performance.
5- Keyed Elements: The use of keys in React components helps the algorithm to accurately identify and track changes in lists, improving efficiency.

Benefits of the Diffing Algorithm:

1- Performance Optimization: By updating only the necessary parts of the DOM, React minimizes the impact of rendering updates on performance, resulting in smoother user experiences.
2- Reduced Browser Reflows: The algorithmâ€™s ability to batch updates reduces browser reflows, which can be resource-intensive and lead to flickering.
3- Responsive Applications: Diffing enables React applications to respond quickly to user interactions and data changes, enhancing overall interactivity.
